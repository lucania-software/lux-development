# Lux Development Repository

## A modern configurable CSS stylesheet.

Lux is a pure, vanilla CSS stylesheet using variables to allow for user configuration!

This project uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to pre-process its CSS. To get started...

1. Clone the repository recursively onto your machine.
   - `git clone --recursive git@github.com:lucania-software/lux-development.git`
2. Install NPM dependencies
   - `npm run setup`
3. Make changes in `./source`, and...
   - ...use Sass to process them with `npm run build`,
   - ...start Sass in watch mode with `npm run build:watch`.

Please see the [Lux Repository](https://github.com/lucania-software/lux) for details on getting started with Lux.
